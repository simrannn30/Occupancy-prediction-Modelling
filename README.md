# Occupancy prediction Modelling
 Occupancy Prediction using ML and DL models such as LSTM, GRU and Linear Regression and selecting the best among them on the basis of their accuracy and results.

 Each model was built and tested separately for the same database and then the findings were compared. It was found that LSTM and GRU are the most suitable for occupancy prediction modelling. GRU gave the most accurate results leading marginally from LSTM followed by linear regression by a good margin.
